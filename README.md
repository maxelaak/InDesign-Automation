# InDesign-Automation
Collection of .py and .jsx scripts to automate Adobe InDesign workflows

# 🛠️ Workflow Automation Scripts

This repository is a collection of **Python (`.py`)** and **ExtendScript (`.jsx`)** scripts designed to streamline and automate repetitive tasks in multilingual, multi-version design workflows — particularly those involving **Adobe InDesign** and shared **network assets**.

## 🔍 What It Does

Working with the same files in multiple languages and across networked environments can be frustratingly slow. These scripts aim to reduce friction by automating tedious tasks such as:

- 🗂️ **Exporting with presets** (PDFs, images, etc.)
- 🌐 **Uploading/downloading localized files** from network locations
- 🖼️ **Relinking images** hosted on network drives
- 🔁 **Batch processing** multiple language versions
- 📂 Keeping file structures consistent across versions

## 🧩 Script Types

- `.py`: Automations written in **Python** (e.g., file handling, network syncing)
- `.jsx`: Scripts for **Adobe InDesign** using **ExtendScript** (e.g., relinking images, exporting with presets)
